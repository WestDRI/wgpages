### Morning materials

Has anyone tried to load their own spatially-defined research dataset into ParaView? Do you have any pictures to share,
or any problems to report?

In this session we will

1. run some exercises from this morning,
1. answer any questions, and
1. review the program for the afternoon (including the exercises).

### Afternon materials

You have **1h30m** of videos to watch this afternoon! These videos were created in May-June 2020, so in few places
(especially the remote and distributed visualization part) the commands point to the older cluster modules. I added the
updated commands next to the videos.

- Today's afternoon topics are covered in `slides2.pdf`.

Do not try to run remote visualization demos on Cassiopeia training cluster: it is not powerful enough to do any CPU
rendering (multi-way virtual CPUs), and it does not have GPUs (and I shut it down before the next school). If you have a
Compute Canada account, you can try a small-scale client-server visualization on Cedar, and a large-scale remote
visualization only if you feel ambitious.

For the hands-on, we'll be focusing mostly on GUI animation and scripting.
