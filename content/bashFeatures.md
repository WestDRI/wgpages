## Abstract

Knowing basic Linux commands is an essential skill for researchers using remote systems such as HPC clusters. Bash is the most commonly used Linux shell, and it is the one you will use by default on most Alliance hardware. We teach Bash basics many times a year in various online schools and in-person workshops. However, there are some useful Bash features and tricks that we never get to teach, due to our usual time constraints, that we would like to share with you in this webinar.

In this presentation we will talk about running commands in a subshell, subsetting string variables, Bash
arrays, modifying separators with IFS, running Python code from inside self-contained Bash functions, editing
your command history, running unaliased versions of commands, handy use of bracket expansion, and a few other
topics.
