## Types of parallel problems

The basic concept of parallel computing is simple to understand: we **divide our job into tasks that can be
executed at the same time**, so that we finish the job in a fraction of the time that it would have taken if
the tasks are executed one by one.

> **Task** is a unit of computation that can run in parallel with other tasks. In this course, we'll be using
> a more general term "task" that -- depending on the context -- could mean either a Unix process (MPI task or

Implementing parallel computations is not always easy. How easy it is to parallelize a code really depends on
the underlying problem you are trying to solve. This can result in:

- a **_fine-grained_**, or **_tightly coupled_** parallel code that needs a lot of communication /
  synchronization between tasks, or
- a **_coarse-grained_** code that requires little communication between tasks.

In this sense **_grain size_** refers to the amount of independent computing in between communication
events. An extreme case of a coarse-grained problem would be an **_embarrassing parallel_** problem where all
tasks can be executed completely independent from each other (no communications required).

In the non-GPU part of this course we'll be solving two numerical problems:

1. **Julia set** is an embarrassingly parallel problem (no communication between tasks), and
1. **heat diffusion** is a tightly coupled problem that requires communication between tasks at each step of
   the iteration.

We'll start with a serial of the Julia set and will use it to learn the basics of Chapel.






## Case study 1: computing the Julia set

This project is a mathematical problem to compute a [Julia set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set),
defined as a set of points on the complex plane that remain bound under infinite recursive transformation
$f(z)$. We will use the traditional form $f(z)=z^2+c$, where $c$ is a complex constant. Here is our algorithm:

1. pick a point $z_0\in\mathbb{C}$
1. compute iterations $z_{i+1}=z_i^2+c$ until $|z_i|>4$ (arbitrary fixed radius; here $c$ is a complex
   constant)
1. store the iteration number $\xi(z_0)$ at which $z_i$ reaches the circle $|z|=4$
1. limit max iterations at 255  
    4.1 if $\xi(z_0)=255$, then $z_0$ is a stable point  
    4.2 the quicker a point diverges, the lower its $\xi(z_0)$ is
1. plot $\xi(z_0)$ for all $z_0$ in a rectangular region $-1<=\mathfrak{Re}(z_0)<=1$,
   $-1<=\mathfrak{Im}(z_0)<=1$

We should get something conceptually similar to this figure (here $c = 0.355 + 0.355i$; we'll get drastically
different fractals for different values of $c$):

**Note**: you might want to try these values too:
- $c = 1.2e^{1.1Ï€i}$ $~\Rightarrow~$ original textbook example
- $c = -0.4-0.59i$ and 1.5X zoom-out $~\Rightarrow~$ denser spirals
- $c = 1.34-0.45i$ and 1.8X zoom-out $~\Rightarrow~$ beans
- $c = 0.34-0.05i$ and 1.2X zoom-out $~\Rightarrow~$ connected spiral boots











## Variables

Chapel is a statically typed language, i.e. the type of every variable is known at compile time.

<!-- A variable has three elements: a **_name_**, a **_type_**, and a **_value_**. When we store a value in a -->
<!-- variable for the first time, we say that we **_initialized_** it. Further changes to the value of a -->
<!-- variable are called **_assignments_**, in general, `x=a` means that we assign the value *a* to the -->
<!-- variable *x*. -->

Variables in Chapel are declared with the `var` or `const` keywords. When a variable declared as `const` is
initialized, its value cannot be modified anymore during the execution of the program.

In Chapel, to declare a variable we must either (1) specify its type, or (2) initialize it in place with some
value from which the compiler will infer its type. The common variable types in Chapel are:

- integer `int` (defaults to `int(64)`, or you can explicitly specify `int(32)`),
- floating point number `real` (defaults to `real(64)`, or you can explicitly specify `real(32)`),
- boolean `bool`, or 
- string `string`

If a variable is declared without a type, Chapel will infer it from the given initial value, for example
(let's store this in `juliaSetSerial.chpl`):

<!-- `baseSolver.chpl` -->

```chpl
const n = 2_000;   // vertical and horizontal size of our image
```

All these constant variables will be created as integers, and no other values can be assigned to these
variables during the execution of the program.

On the other hand, if a variable is declared without an initial value, Chapel will initialize it with a
default value depending on the declared type:

```chpl
var y: real;        // vertical coordinate in our plot; real(64) variable set to 0.0
var point: complex; // current point in our image; complex(64) variable set to 0.0+0.0*1i
```

Of course, we can use both, the initial value and the type, when declaring a varible as follows:

```chpl
const c: complex = 0.355 + 0.355i;   // Julia set constant
```

> Note that these two notations are different, but produce the same result in the end:
> ```chpl
> var a: real = 10;   // we specify both the type and the value
> var a = 10: real;   // we specify only the value (10 converted to real)
> ```
{.note}

Let's print our configuration after we set all parameters:

```chpl
writeln('Computing ', n, 'x', n, ' Julia set ...');
```

### Checking variable's type

To check a variable's type, use `.type` query:

```chpl
var x = 1e8:int;
type t = x.type;
writeln(t:string);
```

or in a single line:

```chpl
writeln((1e8:int).type:string);
writeln((0.355 + 0.355i).type: string);
```
