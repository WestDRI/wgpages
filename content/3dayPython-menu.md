**Description**: Python can be used in many humanities and social sciences workflows, and it is an easy and
fun language to learn. This introductory 3-day, 6-hour course will walk you through the basics of programming
in Python starting at the beginner's level. We will cover the main language features â€“ variables and data
types, conditionals, lists, for/while loops, list comprehensions, dictionaries, writing functions, and working
with external libraries, doing many exercises along the way. In the second part we will take a look at some of
the libraries in more details, including pandas for working with large tables, simple plotting with
matplotlib, and few others.

**Instructor**: Alex Razoumov (SFU)

**Prerequisites**: None.

**Software**: We will be using Python on our training cluster, so no need to install it on your computer. However, in
  the long run you would probably benefit from Python on your computer, so you might want to look into this.
