Python is a popular language for scientific computing, and great for general-purpose programming as well. This
introductory course will walk you through the basics of programming in Python. We will cover the main language
features â€“ variables and data types, conditionals, lists, for/while loops, list comprehensions, dictionaries,
writing functions, and working with external libraries.

**Instructors**: Alex Razoumov

**Prerequisites**: This course assumes some basic knowledge of Python (`for` loops, `if` statements, writing
functions, lists, dictionaries).

**Software**: We will be using Python on our training cluster, so no need to install it on your computer. However, in
  the long run you would probably benefit from Python on your computer, so you might want to look into this.
  
<!-- During the workshop you will likely need a remote secure shell (SSH) client installed on your computer in -->
<!-- order to participate in the course exercises. On Windows we recommend [the free Home Edition of -->
<!-- MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html). On Mac and Linux computers SSH is usually -->
<!-- pre-installed (try typing `ssh` in a terminal to make sure it is there). -->
