## Side material: Matplotlib and Plotly (2 min)

If your goal is 1D or 2D plotting, then ParaView is really an overkill. You can create beautiful 1D/2D (and very simple
3D) graphics with Matplotlib (plotting into a static image file) or Plotly (plotting into HTML, to be viewed
interactively in a browser).

We already covered Matplotlib in our [Python course](../../programming_python) in this school. Plotly is an open-source,
commercially-supported package from a Montreal-based company with the same name. Plotly engine has a Python API and
stores plots inside interactive HTML5 files that can be also be displayed in a Jupyter notebook.

You can find our Plotly notes with script examples [here](../../plotly). Since our goal is learning 3D scientific
visualization with ParaView, we include these notes as a side page for later reading for anyone interested in simpler
plotting. If your goal is learning 3D visualization with ParaView, please don't spend time on Plotly now.

<!-- **Update:** You can also run Plotly on *westgrid.syzygy.ca* from yesterday's Jupyter course. Log in with -->
<!-- your GitHub account -->
<!-- [here in your web browser](https://westgrid.syzygy.ca/jupyter/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fianabc%2FWestGridRSS2020&urlpath=tree%2FWestGridRSS2020%2F), -->
<!-- and then paste the Jupyter-specific codes from the [Plotly notes](../../plotly). For any examples that -->
<!-- read data from files, you will need to upload these files to your notebook (these can be found in the ZIP -->
<!-- download). -->

<!-- If you were following along running Plotly inside a Jupyter notebook on the training cluster, please -->
<!-- click Kernel -> Shutdown and then Logout to close the interface. -->

<!-- You can also log in to the training cluster with SSH, and -- if the job (hosting your JupyterHub) is -->
<!-- still running -- you can terminate it with `scancel` command. -->
