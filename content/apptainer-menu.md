**Instructor**: Alex Razoumov (SFU)

**Target audience**: general

**Level**: beginner

**Prerequisites**: none
<!-- [Introduction to Compute Canada cloud](../cloud_cloud) course -->

This course is a hands-on introduction to working with Apptainer containers in an HPC environment. Apptainer
(formerly Singularity) is a great tool to create custom Linux environments and run off-the-shelf Docker
containers on an HPC cluster. We will look at creating new container images, modifying existing images and
installing software into them and -- if time permits -- running parallel codes inside a container.

<!-- We will be running Docker inside virtual machines (VMs) in Compute Canada cloud, so you must be familiar -->
<!-- with setting up a blank Ubuntu server in a cloud VM before attending this course. -->

**Software**: All attendees will need a remote secure shell (SSH) client installed on their computer in order
to participate in the course exercises. On Mac and Linux computers SSH is usually pre-installed (try typing
`ssh` in a terminal to make sure it is there). Many versions of Windows also provide an OpenSSH client by
default -- try opening PowerShell and typing `ssh` to see if it is available. If not, then we recommend
installing [the free Home Edition of MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html).
