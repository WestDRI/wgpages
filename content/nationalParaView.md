ParaView is an open source, multi-platform data analysis and visualization tool designed to run on a variety of hardware
from an individual laptop to large supercomputers. With ParaView users can interactively visualize 2D and 3D datasets
defined on structured, adaptive and unstructured meshes or particles, animate these datasets in time, and manipulate
them with a variety of filters. ParaView supports both interactive (GUI) and scripted (including offscreen)
visualization, and is an easy and fun tool to learn.

The first session of this workshop will cover some intermediate and advanced topics in 3D scientific visualization with
ParaView including scripting, animation, remote and distributed visualization. In the second session participants will
apply their newly gained knowledge of making animations on different datasets including one from a CFD simulation of a
tidal turbine. Both sessions will be presented in English, with a French version to follow in November.

- Oct-04 (Day 1) - formal introduction to animation, scripting, and remote visualization
- Oct-05 (Day 2) - animating a turbine dataset (keyframe, camera movement, time evolution)

- Instructors: Alex Razoumov, Farhad Baratchi
- Helpers: Jarno van der Kolk, Julie Faure-Lacroix, Marie-Hélène Burle, Tyson Whitehead

## Prerequisites

We expect participants to be somewhat familiar with the basics of ParaView: loading local datasets, interacting with
their visualizations via the GUI, applying filters, and constructing basic visualization pipelines. We ask participants
with no prior experience in ParaView to watch the following videos before attending the workshop:
